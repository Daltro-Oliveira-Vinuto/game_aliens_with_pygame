----------- Alien game with pygame ------------

This is a alien game made with the purpose of wraping up
the concepts of pygame learned in the book "Make games with python"
written by Sean M. Tracey.

The code was made from scratch but using the same main design and ideias
from the final project of the book.

The original code can be found here: https://github.com/seanmtracey/Games-with-Pygame/tree/master/Part%2010

This project is not a fork because its my personal version made from scratch with the objective of learn pygame, practice programming and using good programming practices like: TDD using automated tests, using a static code analysis tool, 
making and using a makefile, using Git and GitHub for version control, checking type hinting and using a interactive debugger. 

I'm using the same pictures and audio from the book and original project.

I modified a lot the original project of the book introducing for example type hinting and introducing new classes in order to build him in a way that make more sense for me.

Important information about the development process: 

I'm using a makefile to help the development process.

I'm using 'pylint' to do static code analysis in order to help in task of keep the code legible.

I'm using 'mypy' for check the type hinting in python.

I'm using 'pytest' for make automated tests of the modules.

I'm using 'pdb' module for interactive debugging.
